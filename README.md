Trends:

1. For Capomulin, with a correlation of 0.84, there is a positive correlation between the mouseâ€™ average tumor volume and its weight.

2. Capomulin and Ramicane: they have the most data points out of all the drugs present in the study. Their median and median tumor volume are the lowest among drugs tested. So they are the most successful drugs in reducing the tumor volume within the mice subjects. Next step is to focus on comparing these two drugs with more comprehensive datasets.

3. For one mouse, its tumor volume is not necessarily declining with timepoint increases though its long term trend is decreasing. Testers should be more patient during testing and provide more timepoint data points.
